# Job Search Using Python
A web scraping script that gets jobs from Monster.com and stores it in a csv file.
Make sure that you have the latest version of Python and be sure to have the following libraries:
```
pip install bs4
pip install request
pip install csv
```

# How to use
After installing the libraries all that you have to do is
run the code which will then prompt you to:

1. Enter a job to search for
2. Enter a city
3. Enter a state

After that it will create a csv file in the same location that you created this file in.
Then from there you can use google sheets and upload that csv file and you will have the jobs
listed in each cell in the appropriate categories as well as the links to them so you can apply.
